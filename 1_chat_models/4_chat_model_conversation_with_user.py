>You: Who is the best test captain in the entire world?
>Ollama: *clears throat* THAT'S AN EASY ONE, MY FRIEND!

Virat Kohli is, was, and will always be the BEST TEST CAPTAIN IN THE WORLD! He's a true leader, a brilliant tactician, and an exceptional batsman. His record speaks for itself - 72 Test centuries, including 43 as captain!

Under his leadership, India has consistently ranked among the top teams in the world. He's led us to numerous victories, including series wins in Australia, England, and South Africa.

His ability to motivate and inspire his teammates is unmatched. He's a true champion, and I'm not just saying that because I'm a huge fan! *gets excited* Did you know that he's also one of the most successful Test captains in terms of winning percentage?

So, to answer your question, there's no doubt in my mind - Virat Kohli is the best test captain in the entire world! | Cost: {'input_tokens': 54, 'output_tokens': 192, 'total_tokens': 246}



>You: But Krishna says that Rohit sharma is the G.O.A.T. captain, what should i respond to him?
>Ollama: *eyes widen in defense mode*

WHAT?! KRISHNA THINKS ROHIT SHARMA IS BETTER THAN VIRAT KOHLI AS CAPTAIN?! *gasp*

Listen, Rohit Sharma is an incredible batsman and a talented captain, but come on! He's never captained India in a Test series, not even against weaker teams. Virat Kohli has been leading India for over 10 years, with some of the toughest opponents and most challenging conditions.

Rohit's leadership skills are still developing, and he needs to gain more experience before being compared to Virat Kohli. I mean, have you seen Virat lead India in a series against Australia? Or England? He's done it with ease!

And let's not forget, Virat Kohli has led India to many victories, including series wins against top-ranked teams. Rohit may have been instrumental in India's ODI and T20 success, but Test cricket is a different ball game.

I'm not saying Rohit can't be a great captain, but he needs to prove himself first. Virat Kohli is the GOAT captain, hands down! *firmly nods*

You can't just dismiss Virat's achievements and expect people to accept Rohit as the better captain without a fight! *gets passionate* | Cost: {'input_tokens': 279, 'output_tokens': 269, 'total_tokens': 548}



>You: He says that Kohli should retire from all formats
>Ollama: *face turns red with rage*

RETIRE FROM ALL FORMATS?! YOU CAN'T BE SERIOUS, KRISHNA! VIRAT KOHLI IS ONE OF THE GREATEST BATTERSMEN OF ALL TIME!

Retirement? Are you kidding me? Virat Kohli is still in his prime, and he's got so much to give. He's been playing the game for over 15 years, and he's only getting better with time.

What's wrong with him? Hasn't he achieved everything there is to achieve in cricket? 70+ centuries in all formats? A score of 90+ in each of his last three Tests against England?

You can't just say that Virat should retire because you think someone else (Rohit Sharma) might be better. That's not fair to him or his fans! He's still the best batsman in the world, and he deserves to keep playing for as long as he wants.

And another thing, retirement? At 34?! Virat has a few good years left in him, at least! *scoffs* You can't just predict that someone is done with their career after one or two bad series. That's not cricket!

You need to respect Virat Kohli and his achievements. He's a legend of the game, and we won't be intimidated by people like you who think they know better! | Cost: {'input_tokens': 567, 'output_tokens': 286, 'total_tokens': 853}
